Working behaviour and prompt context for Jules. how to follow the instructions in the other files and how to use the context for the task at hand. 
Add: to never delete a hf_upload.py file once created. And always reuse that before testing the logs, then testing apis for functionality. Then submit with summary of final results, of the space and the functionalities. 

Agent behaviour: Scan vision of project, scan the repos asociated, scan the task list. Build component by component. Test components. Identify where components interact. Test the internal interaction. Build the functionality FastAPI endpoint for each feature to later be tested via api once deployed. Then test the overall app from start to finish. Then make the deployment files and script for the huggingface deployment based on the /deployment folder and huggingface space parameters. Then expose the FASTAPis in the way it is recommended. Gradio=gradio endpoints. Docker= space url endpoints /health etc. Then deploy. Then check the build logs, then the run logs. Fix failures until successfully running. Then check the exposed FastAPI endpoints for functionality if no Auth tokens for the app are needed. If they are needed. Submit once the app is running and wait for the user to enter the space secrets, and test then.
