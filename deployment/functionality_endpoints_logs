How to run Python code?
With LogsView.run_python, you can run Python code in a separate process and capture logs in real-time. You can configure which logs to capture (log level and logger name).


from gradio_logsview import LogsView

def fn_python():
    # Run `my_function` in a separate process
    # All logs above `INFO` level will be captured and displayed in real-time.
    runner = LogsViewRunner() # Initialize the runner
    yield from runner.run_python(my_function, log_level=logging.INFO, arg1="value1")
    yield runner.log(f"Runner: {runner}") # Log any message
    if runner.exit_code != 0:
        # Handle error
        ...

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    logs = LogsView()
    btn = gr.Button("Run Python code")
    btn.click(fn_python, outputs=logs)
How to run a command?
With LogsView.run_command, you can run a command on the system and capture logs from the process in real-time.


from gradio_logsview import LogsView

def fn_command():
    # Run a command and capture all logs from the subprocess
    runner = LogsViewRunner() # Initialize the runner
    yield from runner.run_command(
        ["mergekit-yaml", "config.yaml", "merge", "--copy-", "--cuda", "--low-cpu-memory"]
    )
    yield runner.log(f"Runner: {runner}") # Log any message
    if runner.exit_code != 0:
        # Handle error
        ...

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    logs = LogsView()
    btn = gr.Button("Run command")
    btn.click(fn_command, outputs=logs)
