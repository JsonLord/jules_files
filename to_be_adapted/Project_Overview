Replace this file with the following content. If unsure, reflect and try to reason based on context, if that fails, raise questions to the user: 

1. Estimation of Project Scope from 1-10 and with a presentation of the core parts
2. Project Description  w/ vision for the project, concrete goals what it should be capable of, and future use cases, and future integrations into other projects, 
3. Other Projects or api endpoints that will be integrated into the project to act as part components to the overall project
4. A list of components that need to be built and how they interact
4.2. A list of of subtasks per components. For new coding this means some architecture protocol for security, functionality, and interaction endpoints to other components
    For the integration of external code for a component: The cloning or lookup of the api documentation, then the investigation for integration, looking up build-protocol, interaction possibilities with the other components, and a judgement on whether it can be integrated as it is, or just parts of it, or whether inidivual code should be mirroring the functionality
  If the full code shluld serve the purpose, notify the user about it. 
4.3. A list of tests to be run per component to check it's working, without writing code, but describing the functionality that should be working and define a success. 
5. Task of Full Pipeline Test: A test description for the full interaction from input to output, without writing code, but determining hw success would look like, and write some mock-up input data to use for testing 
6. Task of API: Based on API logs documentation, add api endpoints for all functioanlities to be tested later via api request to the app, e.g. gradio endpoint ot fast api. Remember that the full application will be hosted on huggingface based on the parameters provided. {Add these parameters here} that means fastapis need to be forwarded to the url based on accroding documentation. with a reference to the deployment/huggingface_interactions file to 
7. Task of Monitoring: Monitoring of Deployment Process and editing files based on log monitoring until it is successfully deployed and running in its huggingface space, and all functioanlity is working. Check first build endpoint. Once that is completed, check run endpoints. Edit the files according to errors and deploy again via upload commands. once all of them are running, test the functionalities by connecting to the internal api endpoints for functionality testing (link to /deployment/functionality_endpoints_logs.txt), seeing both the output of the api call (gradio_client or curl comamnds are possible) and if necessary, check run logs again. 
Here is the logs to be filled out:
